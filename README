Aqua-Sim Next Generation

-------------------------------------

Aqua-Sim is a underwater network simulator. This work consists of rewriting and porting Aqua-Sim (a package originally build on top of NS2, see http://obinet.engr.uconn.edu/wiki/index.php/Aqua-Sim for more information) to NS3 to improve upon current simulation issues such as memory leakage and usage simplicity.

Work supported by the UWSN Lab at University of Connecticut.

--------------------------------------

This code is meant to be as a add-on to current NS3 software and therefore requires NS3 (www.nsnam.org) and all pre-requirements of said software. Current work of Aqua-Sim Next Generation is in very early stages and therefore will be extremely buggy (so use with caution). 

Examples, Tests, and overall protocols are unsupported at this time.
