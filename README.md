## Aqua-Sim Next Generation

-------------------------------------

#### About

Aqua-Sim is a underwater network simulator which supports a vast amount of protocols and features. Originally developed on the basis of [NS-2](http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/), Aqua-Sim can effectively simulate acoustic signal attenuation and packet collisions in underwater sensor networks. Moreover, Aqua-Sim supports three-dimensional deployment. This work consists of rewriting and porting [Aqua-Sim](http://uwsn.engr.uconn.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Aqua-Sim&redirect=no) from [NS-3](www.nsnam.org) to improve upon current simulation issues such as memory leakage and usage simplicity.

Work supported by the UWSN Lab at University of Connecticut.

--------------------------------------
#### Advantages of Aqua-Sim
- Discrete-event driven network simulator
- Support 3D networks and mobile networks
- Simulate underwater acoustic channels with high fidelity
- Implement a complete protocol stack from physical layer to application layer

--------------------------------------

#### Requirements and On-going work
This code is meant to be as a add-on to current NS3 software and therefore requires NS-3 and all pre-requirements of said software. Current work of Aqua-Sim Next Generation is in very early stages and therefore will be extremely buggy (so use with caution). 

Examples, Tests, Helpers and overall protocols are unsupported at this time.
